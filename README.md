# Pyrandom2pm

Pyrandom2pm is a fun package to generate random results with four functions responding to user inputs. This could be used for random number generation, using a random Yes or No response to answer your questions using 8-ball, returning the culmulative result of a given number of coin flips as a string, and calculating the sum of up to two dices with user-defined number of sides. Automatic pytests have been programmed for automativ testing for each commit on github.
